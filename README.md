# PRC Data Challenge 2026: taxi-out time, team merry-octopus

Predict `TAXITIME_SEC_mvt` (takeoff minus off-block, seconds) for departures at ten European airports.
Scored by RMSE on January and July 2026. Licence: GPLv3 (`LICENSE`).

## How the label was made, and why the model looks like it does

The takeoff time is given in the test file. The off-block time is blanked. So the unknown is one timestamp,
and in the training data that timestamp is one of four things:

| recorded off-block | share of 2025 departures | prediction if we knew the class |
|---|---|---|
| the AOBT from the flight plan (within 60 s) | ~19% | takeoff minus AOBT |
| the EOBT from the flight plan | ~9% | takeoff minus EOBT |
| the scheduled time (heavy at LIRF, up to hours before takeoff) | ~1.5% | takeoff minus schedule |
| a physical time (real pushback), occasionally shifted by a day | ~70% | needs a regressor |

The model is that mixture: a multiclass classifier gives P(class | features), the three stamp classes use their
known timestamp, and a gradient-boosted regressor fitted only on physical rows gives the rest.
`yhat = sum_k P(k) * z_k + P(other) * mu(x)`. RMSE is minimised by the conditional mean, and the mixture is the
conditional mean written out. See `docs/EXPLORE.md`, `docs/AUDIT.md` and `docs/RESULTS.md` for the numbers.

## Features (`features.py`, `weather.py`)

From the challenge files: gaps from takeoff to each stamp, differences between stamps, stamp rounding, calendar
(hour, weekday; month is never a feature), categorical ids (airport, runway, stand, type, operator, destination,
airline prefix), counts of movements in the same file around the estimated off-block and the takeoff, airport-day
aggregates (`DAY`), and stand occupancy (`OCC`): whether the next arrival parked on the departure's stand before
its takeoff, and how long before. Occupancy carries most of the feature gain (`docs/RESULTS.md`, ablation lines).

Weather (`WX`): IEM ASOS METAR archive, one CSV per airport under `data/weather/<pull date>/`, fetched with
`python weather.py fetch 2026-09-05` (stations EDDF EDDM EGLL EHAM LEBL LEMD LFPG LIRF LSZH LTFM, UTC,
2024-12-31 to the pull date; the shipped pull ends 2026-08-01, and later rows touch no anchor). Joined as-of the estimated off-block: wind, gust, visibility, temperature, ceiling,
present-weather codes, a 3 h thunderstorm count and the age of the observation. Precipitation (`p01i`) is 0 on
every European row, so it is dropped. No ADS-B.

As-of rule: a feature may use any movement in the same file, before or after the takeoff (the rules allow it;
`dep_after` and `arr_off` look forward).

## Lane B (no flight plan)

About half of the rank-set squared error sits on the ~5k departures without a plan, mostly LIRF, where the recorded
off-block is often the schedule. A second, small LightGBM classifier fitted on lane B only gives P(schedule copy)
and overrides the stamp probabilities on those rows (`bclf` in `mix.py`). It helps the LightGBM mixture
(+3.65 s on holdout, CI excludes zero) and not the CatBoost one, so it enters only through the blend.

## Validation (`train.py`, `mix.py`)

Holdout = January and July 2025, never used for model choice. CV = five folds over the other ten months,
by month pair. Every result line reports per lane (A = has a flight plan, B = no plan) and per month.
Predictions are floored at 0. Board uploads are logged in `LEDGER.md` with the expected and actual score.

## Reproduce the submitted file (v21)

v21 = 0.648 * CatBoost mixture (`mix_cb_wx`) + 0.352 * LightGBM mixture with the lane-B classifier (`mix_lgb_wxb`).
Weights are non-negative least squares on the CV out-of-fold predictions (`blend.py`), never on the holdout.
Holdout Jan+Jul 2025: 340.21 all, 246.74 lane A, 1891.47 lane B (`docs/RESULTS.md`).

CatBoost on GPU is not bit-reproducible run to run; expect about 1 s of holdout noise. `tune.py` runs Optuna over
the mixture regressor on CV folds only (`python tune.py N_TRIALS 2-3,6-8`, study in `data/optuna.db`).
